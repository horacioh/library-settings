# Library Explorations

Basic Example of Layout and interactions related to the library item for my upcoming app [Mintter](https://mintter.com)

## Features you can find:

- [x] control the visibility (`open` or `close`)
- [x] control the location (`left` or `right`)
- [ ] resize it (like the VSCode library)
